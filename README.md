[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/daviddenton/http4k-demo-irc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/daviddenton/http4k-demo-irc.svg?branch=master)

This is a simple IRC clone built with [**http4k**](https://http4k.org) and deployed to Heroku through a fully CD pipeline run on Travis. the full application is 30 lines of code (when imports are excluded).

It uses the following [**http4k**](https://http4k.org) modules and features:

- http4k core `http4k-core`
- Jetty server module `http4k-server-jetty` including unit-testable Websockets
- http4k core `http4k-cloudnative` for configuration
- Shared behavioural contracts for Unit (offline) and Server (online) testing of Websockets. Ie. 1 contract, reusable across testing scopes.

It is deployed into Heroku [**here**](http://http4k-demo-irc.herokuapp.com/).
